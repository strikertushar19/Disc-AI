# Disc AI

**Disc AI** is an intelligent learning platform designed to make understanding new concepts fun, engaging, and effective through *discussion-based learning*.  
Built with **FastAPI** (Python), **Next.js** (JavaScript/TypeScript), and cutting-edge **Agentic AI**, Disc AI creates a conversational environment between you and two voice agents ‚Äî **Mike** and **Mily** ‚Äî who help you deeply understand topics or articles you want to learn.

> ‚ú® Because *discussion* makes learning better ‚Äî even if you don't always have someone to talk to!

## Why Disc AI?

Many people learn better through conversation, but not everyone has a study partner or feels comfortable talking to others. Disc AI solves this by providing two friendly, knowledgeable AI agents who:

- **Discuss the topic** with you
- **Ask and answer questions** to deepen your understanding
- **Explain complex ideas** in simple terms
- **Make learning interactive, not passive**

It's like having your own intelligent learning buddies ‚Äî always ready to chat in voice!

---

## Problem Statement

Many learners struggle with understanding new concepts through passive methods like reading articles or watching videos.  
However, active discussion greatly improves learning, but:

- Not everyone has study partners or friends available.
- Many people feel uncomfortable discussing openly.
- Traditional online learning feels one-sided and non-interactive.

**Disc AI** was created to simulate real, dynamic discussions to improve learning outcomes without needing another human on the other side.

---

## Challenges

- Designing agents that **feel natural** in discussion, not robotic.
- Ensuring **real-time voice interaction** with low latency.
- Handling **complex topic breakdowns** dynamically.
- Keeping the conversation **engaging and user-driven**.
- Building a **scalable backend** that can handle multiple sessions.

---

## How We Solve It

- **Agentic AI Models:**  
  Mike and Mily aren't just answering ‚Äî they reason, debate, and build understanding through conversation.
  
- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction:**  
  Using the Web Speech API and ElevenLabs text-to-speech models for seamless voice interaction.

- **Dynamic Conversation Flow:**  
  Agents adjust explanations based on the user's responses and engagement level.

- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  FastAPI powers the backend, managing WebSocket connections for live conversation, while Next.js ensures a fast frontend experience.
